- 👋 Hi, I’m @DangSys
- 👀 I’m interested in system infrastructure
- 🌱 I’m currently learning System/OS(Debian, Redhat)/MonitoringTool(Grafana,Prometheus)/Script(Bash,Python)/Hosting(Nginx,Apache))
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on System Automization.
- 📫 How to reach me : dangvq.sys@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns:
    - "There is no lose. Only win or lession"
    - "I can accept failure, but can't accept not trying"
    - "Nếu không có sự chuẩn bị đẩy đủ, một đĩa thành công sẽ được đổi bằng một mâm thất bại"
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have just swapped from Enterprise Networking to System Administration recently. This page will record my process in this adventure.

Let's have a coffee with me and talk about monitoring tools, network and system automization.

Already chapter 5, this is so well-explaned by professional CCIE instructors.

I always wish to meet these great mentors in my life.
